    <p>
      I have had a few hours of lessons with Andy now and I’m sure
      I’ll be using him again in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time he came well prepared and he even went the extra
      mile after our call to help me put into practice his advice
      and to review my code.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were multiple ‘lightbulb’ moments from our calls that
      have really helped me to improve my programming. Andy is
      able to explain things in a very clear and understandable
      way. He is also very good at explaining the different ways
      to do things and his opinions on the pros and cons of each way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped point out a lot of code smells and taught me not
      only how to fix them but also how to avoid making the same
      mistakes in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would recommend anyone who wants to improve their Ruby skills and knowledge to hire Andy.
